It seems like, in one way or another, I may be fated to take the Arbiter's place and Fractallite power.\nOne of the faithful of the arbiter has approached me, and told me the Fluix Historians are ready to support me in my struggle against the Meatball Man.\nThey gave a fabrial, one that would be able to set off the full might of the Withers against the Meatball Man.\nThis is all nice and good, I think I know what I am doing here, but it leaves the matter of Alchemy, and my own state as the 'chosen one', open.\nWhat sort of plan put me where I am now? I was simply a greedy scientist looking for fame. What about me put me on this journey that was clearly laid out by design.",
