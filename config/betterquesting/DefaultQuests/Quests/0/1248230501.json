A bit of rocketry will still be required, but it'd be a one-time thing!\n\n§fWow, of course Bees have developed extremely advanced Wormhole technology. I love the Bees!\nStepping through a Stargate, that feels quite cool, I will not deny it...\nIt seems like these structures play an important role in the history, tradition, and culture of Bees. Those that are capable of producing components for these Stargates appear to be highly regarded by the rest of the Bees. This reminds me of how priests and monks are treated by humans. I wonder if their religion has something to do with Stargates...",
