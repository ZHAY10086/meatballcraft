Time always passes. Chaos always grows. The Army of Darkness never stops growing.\nBy itself this process is slow. Not geologically slow. Not planetarily slow. Cosmically slow. \nEven for the universe itself, the growth of this army, by itself, would be a slow process, and yet Bane, thanks to its powers, was able to catalyze it, and to turn it into a dangerous growth, one that ever theratens to expand through all the universe, if given the chance.\nThis would be the end of time.",
