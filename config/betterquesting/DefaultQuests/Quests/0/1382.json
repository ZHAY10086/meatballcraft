      "desc:8": "Whoever ruled the ancient people of Zoi was a Fractallite, and their powers revolved around solitude. A negative emotion, and yet a call to action, to seek company, to seek the shared experience of life that makes it worth living. A call to company so strong that its ripples, in the form of pink stones that fall upwards, made it all the way to Terra.\nAn emotion now twisted by the Scientist of the Meatball Man, its use as a means of betterment now made a joke. All that one can feel in Zoi now, despite how full of creatures it is, is of solitude. A loneliness so strong that it is easy to think it will never end.\nBut it will, that is what I am here to do.\nI cannot bring this place back to its glory, but I can at least add one more ruin future travellers may find. The ruin that marks the start of my campaign against the Meatball Man.\nNo more going along with your games. No more fights against a bored god. We may not be equals yet, but I know I can bring him down, and I will do everything I can to do it.\nThe Arbiter, after all, has to resume their mission!\nI have to resume this mission!",
