      "desc:8": "Nero is a place. Nero is a person. Nero is people.\nBody. Soul. Breath. Heart.\nEver-existing reminders of helplessness.\nA body given pristine, and a world where it can easily be broken.\nA soul born unstained, and a free will to darken it.\nA breath of life taken, and the ability to take it from others.\nA heart thumping for life, and the wants that can stop it.\nShrieks of inevitability. Monuments to helplessness. Waters of forgone conclusions.\nThat\u0027s what we all face. Powerful and powerless. High and low. Strong and weak. Rich and poor. \nBorn of ideals, living in imperfect flesh. Existing in the helplessness of things we cannot change.\nReady to give in, and yet striving.\nStriving to exist despite it. Striving to face it. Striving to see it.\nI want to see it.\nI have to see it.\nI must see it.\nI shall see it.\nI will see it.\nI see it.\nI saw it.\nI saw the face of Nero, and I survived.",
