      "desc:8": "The way recursive materials and objects interact with pretty much everything and every other magic field is truly remarkable!\nI think I know what makes magic \u0027mythic\u0027, what makes it evolve into something capable of acting against the laws of nature. It is an extended and expanded version of \u0027normal\u0027 magic that uses said laws of nature. Expanded by what? Well, recursion, or whatever the force that keeps me alive and immortal is.\nJust combining the metals from the world of Barathos has changed their magic properties into something new and powerful, way more powerful. \nI still have no idea how this force (is it a force?) works, but I cannot deny how impactful it is. If I want to get ahead in this universe of mythological deities and planet-destroying powers, control recursion is what will make me more powerful without necessarily gaining knowledge in other fields.\nI still strongly suspect that, to understand recursion, I will have to understand everything else first.",
