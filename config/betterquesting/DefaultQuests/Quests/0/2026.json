All places touched by the power of the Twilight Horde. These locations are all planarly oriented, while the space outside of these planes is asymptotically converging, making it impossible to get far.\nHaven is the same. Lelyetia too; well not quite, as its gravity also includes a plane of convergence, likely driven by the effects of fluctuatite.\nThe same space-folding power that allows the Twilight Horde to shape their worlds in such a way has entered the hands of the Shyre at some point. Otherwise, the Haven would not look like Wildwood, it will be more like Lelyetia.\n'They were betrayed, and so will he', the device keeps saying...",
