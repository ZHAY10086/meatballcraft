      "desc:8": "Yes, the Twilight Horde was Betrayed.\nWho knows what the Shyre Empire must've promised, but the 'Power of the Shells', the ability to create these planar worlds like Arcana, was given away by Parasecta.\nThis is precious information, and I am sure it will aid in this conflict.\nNow I think I may know how the Twilight Empire is organized, the pattern is getting more evident. The territories of the Horde are organized in layers, the 'Mythic Shells'. These worlds are close to each other, like a book held loose, where the pages don't quite touch, but are still close. The space between them has been made asymptotycally convergent, so that it is impossible to move between these worlds without the power and knowledge of Twiligh Horde beings.\nRecently, the Shyre Empire gained knowledge of this ability, so it is safe to assume their territories may follow a similar organization.\nHow many more 'pages' do I have to peel before I reach the rulers?\nThis power also seems to be manifesting itself spontaneously, in the form of the twisted worlds of dimensional doors, the Warrens.",
