Gems that can phase in and out of higher dimensions, blood-imbued myrmitite that self-replicates. All of these felt like 'shadows' of something bigger, something more powerful.\nWhile shadows only provide of a single slice of the true nature of something, if enough shadows from enough angles are used, it is possible to get a good idea about the object that originates them.\nAnd so, I was able to make pure recursive matter. \nMy first Mythic Fractal!",
