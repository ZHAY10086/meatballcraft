      "desc:8": "I really like the feeling of learning something new! Even when it is something I still barely understand.\nI learned a new type of magic, the power of Stormlight! As indicated by its name, its origin lies in storms. The field that produces this magic is an emergent property from the entropic movement of large amounts of air and water.\nWhile its origin lies in disorder, it is order that binds it; the more uniform the lattice of a crystal, the more of this energy can be held.\nNow, what do I do with it? How do I release it? I am sure these questions will find their answers soon, I will just have to keep searching; probably not on Apichisi, nor on Crystevia. \nThe place these Wyverns come from is where I may find a new ally, and learn of new powers. Just as it was in Mysterium, it is reassuring to know there are others out there that cannot stand what the Shyre Empire is doing.",
