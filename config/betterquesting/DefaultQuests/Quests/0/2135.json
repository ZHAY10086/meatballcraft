      "desc:8": "Due to its already-evident breadth and reach, it is no surprise that many of the civilizations that are offered membership to the Shyre Empire accept. Compared to the alternative of being destroyed by the largest empire in the universe, becoming an instrument of violence for said empire is an appealing offer, even when it involves considerable depravity against other civilizations.\nDespite this, there are many powerful beings that have attempted retaliation. Due to their possibly-useful powers, instead of defeating them, the Shyre Empire imprisoned them in the asteroids of Lunalus, where they are broken by its jailer.\nThe Lunar Lover is a twisted creature, capable of ensnaring the minds of its subjects into submission. For those that have been broken by the jailer, there is no hope of return, but by defeating this enemy I can at least ensure the same will not happen to anyone else.",
