It is thanks to it that its full ptential can shine. And what a potential! I think I am starting to understand why runes may be interesting.\nAnd yet, Runandor actively ignores it. Why? Wouldn\u0027t they want to make use of it, especially with the Shyre Empire\u0027s pressures around power and its use?\nThis intentionality stinks of hidden history. Something in Runandor\u0027s past led to this situation. It has to! There is no way the people here are just blind to it!",
