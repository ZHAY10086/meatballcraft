      "desc:8": "Well, the destruction caused by Chaotic Reactors may have its uses, actually. Draconium, a mineral that is already quite capable of interfacing with entropy directly, actively reacts to the explosions from the reactor, reaching a maximum-entropy state itself, and gaining useful properties.\nOne of them, interestingly enough, is to 'bind' (for the lack of a better word) to other maximum-entropy draconium, essentially acting as a universe-spanning detector of others who have discovered this same material, and a catalyst to open new wormholes. \nWell, one wormhole, just one. I am only the second to ever do this. The people of Lyndenwyrm, a planet naturally inhabited by dragons and other beasts capable of manipulating entropy, were, until now, the first and only civilization of unlocking the secrets of chaos. This is where the Wyvern I fought on Apichisi is from.\nLyndenwyrm is a planet that, at some point, actively took part in universal conflicts. Now, though, it is just a barren wasteland, actively charged of an insane amount of static electricity. An unfriendly and dangerous place.",
