Sort of...\nThe power of the Abyss is a dangerous one, a very universal one; anyone that is made of flesh, of animal organic matter, can fall pray of this power, if their will is bent.\nAnd let's be honest, just looking at the vastness of the flesh infaction in the Abyss can be enough to bend many brave souls' will.\nI am amazed by the amount of powerful beings that were brought under the Shyre Empire; any of the creatures I have fought could probably make a substantial damage to the universe by themselves...\nThe power over flesh, gravity, religion, immortality, time itself; the list goes on. What could have pushed all these beings together? How have they not started waging war against each other?",
