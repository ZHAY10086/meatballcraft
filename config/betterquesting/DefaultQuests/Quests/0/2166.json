      "desc:8": "Despite the grueling fight, I think I actually defeated these enemies. Not 'defeated' like Bane or the Primordial Fractallites, where my actions felt to have little effect on their power. \nNo, actual defeat, if that were possible. I defeated, truly defeated, Fractallite beings.\nHow? Well, I can only guess, but I believe it must have something to do with an incomplete coupling with their Fractallite powers, almost as if it took some time for it to 'settle down', and I was able to stop the merging before it was complete.\nWhat supports this theory is what Dracyon and Hydrolisk left behind. I am fumbling for words, but whatever this thing is, it is as close to pure recursion as my senses have encountered, and yet it hints at something more, just like a complex shape that is only seen from one angle, and is thus distorted.\n ",
