I swear they seem to exist solely to torment me.\nThe Meatball Man has a lot of power and influence, at least comparable with the Twilight Horde, but all his forces do is toy with me, and nobody else.\nThe undead forces and the other Meatball creatures are only interested in me and the Testificates, and they don't seem to want anything beyond torment. Why don't they build empires or search for resources like the other people that are high on the Kardashev scale? They just cause chaos. \nWell, to be fair, it is very possible I am not seeing the big picture of the Meatball Man's plans, but it feels like I am interacting with a very bored kid during school, just trying to find something to do to be entertained.",
