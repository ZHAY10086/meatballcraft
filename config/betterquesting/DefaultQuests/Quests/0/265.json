      "desc:8": "UU Matter, which is synthetically produced, has mythical properties. \nThet's why I love science! It allows us to connect things that seem otherwise unrelated. The fact that using fairly ordinary matter from scraps it is possible to produce stuff with mythic properties implies that magic, whatever the nature of its fiels is, is indeed present in everything. Not just as an emergent property, but as an inherent one, just like mass and charge!\nThis is nice because it will allow me to 'boost' my void resource miners! most of the matter that interacts with Shyre and Twilight Horde beings seems to have more 'mythicness', more quantity of magic, so UU matter should come in handy for making more miners!\nI'm going to need a 'crucible' to refine this matter with alchemy, though...",
