Many of the places I visited are worlds that exist in higher-dimensional planes, and bees believe this is the peak of what recursion can do. But boy were they wrong.\nIf the existance of places like Lelyetia is a showcase of basic (if something that can only be done by a master of recursion can be called basic) space warping abilities, this recent discovery shows what becomes possible if you're a master at it.\nNot only the Horde can deform space-time to create their own environments, they can up fold it like origami! And they are the only ones who can do it.\nThe Eden realm I entered is just a 'fold' of the horde's territory, and if I want to reach the rest of their land, I will have to 'jump' on next fold, the next Mythic Shell.",
