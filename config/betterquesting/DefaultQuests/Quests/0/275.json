The asymptotically-convergent space surrounding the plane of Eden can be breached!\nAfter opening wormholes, traces remain, and they can be reopened, even by a poor three-dimensional like me!\nI've seen these traces over and over, and I can't help but wonder, did the first wormhole I opened also leave a trace? \nAfter what I've been through coming back to Earth would feel wrong, but can someone else access the wormhole I opened? Can others reach Earth?\nThe Twilight Horde is definitely interested in me, they even had a copy of my transmutation table in one of their outposts. They know of me, but do they know where I come from? Can they do anything to Earth?",
