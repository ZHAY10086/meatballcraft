Garnets, for example, are good to have in a steady supply.\n\nMake sure your autocrafts are fast and reliable. If there are multiple recipes for one item, it'll be a good idea to use the easiest option available at the moment.\n\nTake a look at the side quests! There are lots of goodies there that should help out!",
