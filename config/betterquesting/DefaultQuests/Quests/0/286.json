      "desc:8": "After all I have seen, things make more sense now; the energy recursive powers, at their heart, revolve around the fact that it is possible for a field to reinforce itself in a loop, that is why the are called the way they are. This, I thought, directly clashed with the principle of entropy, of the universal push of the entirety of nature towards chaos.\nAnd yet, after having encountered Shub'Asothoth and the Avatar of the Meatball Man, after having seen what they are capable of, I have to admit that this apparent clash is just a product of my own ignorance.\nI just don't know how entropy truly works. To truly understand Recursion, and to understand Fractallite powers, one has to undertand entropy.\nThankfully, dragons that appear to wield power over entropy as if it were nothing can be found all around the asteroids of Terra.",
