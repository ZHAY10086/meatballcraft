It is a pathological functional space.\nIf the barrier between the Eden and Wildwood can be thought as a single fold, the barrier to Apalachia is an infinite series of folds going back and forth, each producing a smaller and smaller effect, the Barrier to the next World, Skythern, is a series of folds, where there are infinitely many folds between each pair, over and over, in an endlessly self-repeating fractal of space, continuous, yet unreachable.\nThis is not the first time I think of this, but I cannot help but be impressed at how amazing some of my enemies' creations are.
