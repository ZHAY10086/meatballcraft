Actually, it may have made things worse. Why are the Testificates now saying that they would not mind just giving up, and making a pact with the Twilight Horde?\nWhat is going on? It is as if none of the enemies I defeated was actually defeated. Sure, recursion does that, but I have been using my powers to ensure this would not happen. Is this because I am dealing with Fractallites? Are there other rules to this game I have not been aware of?\nHave I just been a fool, pushing a rock that was already in motion regardless of my actions? No it cannot be!",
