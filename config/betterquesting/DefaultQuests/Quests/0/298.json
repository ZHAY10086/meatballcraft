Given what I know so far, I may even go as far as saying that it is the foundation of reality. By following the path of recursion, it is possible to perceive where it was used to do magic, including the one used to create the Mythic Shells.\nI may not yet be capable of grasping the nature of Fractallite powers, but I know that this will be my next step. One final Mythic Shell, one that is not only is walled off through Warren magic, but one that can only be perceived and touched by being Fractallite. \nI do not have that ability yet, but my understanding of Recursion is getting to that point. The waters of Fractal might are deep and vast, and I am only now dipping my feet. Well, this is a start, I know what the fulcrum of the Twilight Horde's power lies, Mortum, the final Shell. I cannot get there yet, I have not ascended to the level of understanding required to reach through this barrier, but I know that such a barrier does exist, and I know where it is.",
