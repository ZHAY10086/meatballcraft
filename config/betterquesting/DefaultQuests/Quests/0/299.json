It should be a good way to take a break from Vethea progression too!\n\n§fYup, I dipped my feet in the waters of Fractal might. Now I know, at least partially, what is coming.\nI won't just have to fully enter this vast and deep ocean, I will have to reach its bottom.\nWhile I still do not know what this will entail, and I likely won't until I get there, I can say that a sacrifice will be required, and something will need to be let go.\nWell, I already have to let go...\nSleep, a sleep of nighmares, a sleep of nightmares, a sleep of helplessness, a sleep of fear, a sleep of solitude.\nI must face my own self, or whatever form my own essence takes at the layer of recursion. I must know who I am to become before I try to become it.\nIt it time to leave it all behind, it is time to start swimming down, deeper and deeper. And deeper still.",
