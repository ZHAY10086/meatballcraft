Are we truly free, or are our actions the only phycically reasonable reaction to a universe that progresses without agency?\nThanks to what I am capable of seeing in myself, I know I have agency. I also know that there are things I will do. Not 'can do', 'will do'. What are these things? I am getting closer to understanding them, and I suspect that my ascension will involve achieving this understanding, but I do not yet know them.\nSo the paradox persists. It seems that, even at this most fundamental level of reality, the paradox persists.",
