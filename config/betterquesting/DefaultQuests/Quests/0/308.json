Very few make it here!\n\n§fMy mission for the sake of Terra, while clear to me, is not a simple one.\nAs I fought the invaders, in my early days of this journey, traces of a strange name, what I now know to be a place, kept showing up in different places from different voices.\nThis place, in some way, is the origin of many of the aims and motivations for those that seek Dimensional Shards. My mission is one of protection, and while it will inevitably lead me to the Shyre Empire or the Twilight Horde, it is not time to face them yet.\nThe loose end for all the other invaders needs to be addressed as well.\nAnd that loose end is Dynatos, the black hole of recursion. Born of both magic and gravity, this place is a universal fulcrum of power, the ripples of which have reached Terra.",
