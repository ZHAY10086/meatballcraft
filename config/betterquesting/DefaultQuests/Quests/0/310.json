The hidden rules of much of the universe, here, on the dead soil of Akathartos, rule from the height of might, and show their true face, unmasked, and marked by darkness.\nTrue darkness. Recursive darkness. \nThe primal darkness in the heart of every person, of every consciousness, when they realize other people, other consciousness, can be used, exploited, manipulated.\nThat is the darkness that drives the crimson cult. The darkness that ruined lives without them even knowing.\nAn evil that defeated many, and that shall now be defeated.\nAt all costs.",
