      "desc:8": "Is this how a Fractallite falls? The realization that no, they are not their mission, that they cannot fully be their mission. Given a fate, and yet truly still imperfectly human, despite having the powers of a god. The paradox remains, and fate can be denied. Not just once, not twice, not any number of times. Fate can be denied at any point. It is a constant struggle. And the struggle is so hard now.\nI am not in a good place. I know a lot of this is just in my mind, and yet I cannot deny it is real.\nA gluttonous thirst for war, for confrontation, for enemies. That is what guided me. That is why my subconscious kept pushing on, while my rational mind was bathing in the light of self righteousness.\nAnd now that the confrontation is gone, I can see how much of my motivation depended on this. No, that is not true. I already saw this obsession, hints of it, many times. Warp brings it out, and in Vethea it was made more evident than ever before.\nAnd yet, back then, I was capable of embracing it. That suddenly feels liek an age ago. Why is it so hard to accept now?\nIs it because I thought I would feel some sort of relief? Some closure?\nI just need to resist. I know embracing this part of me is how I may get out of it one day, but that is not the time. \nI can feel it, this whole thing is not over. Something else is going to happen, and I cannot falter now.\nI just have to resist. I just have to resist. I just have to resist.",
