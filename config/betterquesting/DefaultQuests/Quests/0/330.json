      "desc:8": "Not only Shyre tech can easily open wormholes, but it actually deforms space-time, and make higher dimensions intersect.\nSimilar to how the Dungeon of Arcana took over the halls of the Aesirs, some power over gravity and space-time allows for the land of Lelyetia to exist in a discontinuity in gravity. Well, that\u0027s the best way I can explain this place.\nMathematical functions and fields can have discontinuities; jumps, changes in slope (that\u0027s a discontinuity in a derivative I know), varying variables depending on domains, and singularities. Humanity already knew of singularities, those are black holes, and I guess both Arcana and now Lelyetia are manifestation of these discontinuities.\nWonder if, given enough sednanite, I may be able to achieve something like this, to create a world that is not spherical, or maybe a cosmic string?\n",
