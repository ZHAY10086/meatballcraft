      "desc:8": "Bad news! This planet-corrupting soul is way too powerful for me to handle. This may be the single most powerful thing I have encountered until now. Well, the Meatball Man may be stronger, but it seems like he does not want to reveal his hand to me yet. Actually, for all I know there may be lots of other enemies doing the same; I feel small, small and weak.\nGood news! Things will have to go very wrong for such an enemy to enter the battlefield of Terra, or else the Twilight Horde will pull out their big guns too.\nI just have to be careful about showing myself directly helping the Testificates in the warpers, or the Shyre Empire may have a reason to think that the forces of Terra want to escalate this conflict.\nFrom now on, it will be better if I showed myself as an ally to the Bubbell Alliance of bees. They don't seem to have a direct stake on Terra, they have a suprising amount of fire power, and they are more than willing to endorse my actions.",
