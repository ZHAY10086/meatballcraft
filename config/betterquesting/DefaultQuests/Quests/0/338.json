      "desc:8": "I will say, I am very surprised that the Shyre Empire has no knowledge of alchemy. \nWeirdly enough, my second option was correct. Some of the higher ups in the empire, for some reasons still unknown, use charged runium for their own magic art, runation. It is not the first time I encountered it. Some Testificate Alchemists on Terra still practice it, and it is a way to use alchemy as a weapon in ways that would not otherwise be possible, but it has long been outclassed by other arts such as astral sorcery. \nThe Testificates that still practice it do so in case there may be undiscovered secrets. Those of the Shyre Empire, on the other hand, out of the hundreds of worlds they control, have not a single alchemist in their midsts. That's why they even have secure portal lines to connect the Deeplands to one of the governing worlds.\nWhat are the requirements that make alchemy so common among Testificates and bees, and yet so uncommon anywhere else. The only thing I can think of is compassion, but that can't be it. Right?",
