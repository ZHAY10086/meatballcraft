And yet again, something that is beautiful and interesting has been ruined by futher discoveries. I swear I am not turning into a nihilst, but it sure is hard being able to look at this without some sort of coping to detach from the awful things I see.\nImagine existing and living solely to be a suicide bomber. The sole purpose of your creation being used as a weapon. I have appreciated many things about Shyre civilization, but this is yet another reminder of how evil and scary this empire is.\nTheir complete lack of ethics is chilling. ",
