      "desc:8": "The prophecy of the Arbiter, the last writ of this nearly-all-knowing being, told of one person, one not from Terra, who would arrive from meteorite of sky stone, at the peak of an eclipse, and followed by the Rainbours. This newcomer would be given the blessing of alchemy, and the power to restore balance between order and chaos.\nThis is me, I am the one the prophecy predicted. That is why the Testificates were asking those specific questions, that is why the Meatball Man is interested in me!\nAlchemy is a strange one. I was never capable of feeling it until I came to Terra, but now it is just second nature—almost as if the other conditions in the prophecy were part of a ritual to unlock that ability within me. The ability to access this type of magic, after all, is rare and precious—so rare and precious that the Shyre Empire was content to take the scraps of any weakened form of it for runation. \nAnd while the prophecy predicts my coming, it does not state my purpose.\nWhat is this prophecy predicting? What role am I to play in this battle? Why me? What does this restoration of balance between order and chaos mean?\nWell, I may get some more answers in my next voyage. For just an instant, the strange characters left by the Arbiter began to make sense, and just like that, they turned back into gibberish. Coordinates to a space between the Proxima Stars. That is where the sky stone meteorites come from, that is where I will find more answers!",
