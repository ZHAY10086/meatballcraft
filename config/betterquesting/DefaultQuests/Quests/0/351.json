      "desc:8": "The asteroid belt between the Proxima stars is a strange place, filled with technology that looks faintly familiar.\nTechnology left here by the Arbiter for me, that much I know, otherwise why would I have understood the strange characters as soon as I knew of the prophecy.\nThese satellites mark an important location for the Arbiter, a place where he experimented, and played with recursion to generate new materials and technologies.\nFrom what I know, the Arbiter was some sort of engineer, who studied magic in a way similar to what I am doing now. he was much more powerful than me, at least as I am now, and was able to come up with something that does not quite make sense.\nMatter that is, well, just matter, with no other identification. What color is it? I'm not sure. Is it heavy? No idea. No matter what I do, what property I measure, the readings come out different every time. Whatever this is, its main property is being unidentified.\nAfter learning what I now know from Ogerite and how recursive properties can be passed on, I believe I should be able to give this 'unidentifiableness' to other matter.",
