I could have quit. I could have left it all behind. I could have acted as the selfish, petty, pretentious person I am.\nBut I did not, and according to Testificate lore, someone doing the exact things I did was foretold.\nI know I am free, I can feel it, I can see it. But still, my actions were prophesized.\nWell, my own freedom, at the end of the day, is my ability to act, to participate in life. If this life is where I am to participate, my freedom is dependent on my ability to say 'yes' to this life. And I did. ",
