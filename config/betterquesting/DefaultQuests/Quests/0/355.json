Or is it because of who I am?\nAnd why do I have the strong suspicion that their motivations may also be tied to the prophecies of the Testificates?\nWas I the 'chosen' by these prophecies all along, just a feather in the wind? Or were my own actions that simply directed me towards a life someone else may have lived?\n",
