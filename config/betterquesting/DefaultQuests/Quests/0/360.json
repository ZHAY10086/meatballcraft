Densos and Reyvor.\nThe Great Minds of the Twilight Horde. The Soul Fiend, and the Twilight Demon.\nTogether, the Halite Warriors, heads to the Twilight Horde. \nFinally, a confrontation with those that orchestrated the invasion of Terra.\nNot only the core of power of the Horde consists of multiple beings, they are all Fractallites.\nThe history that led to the formation of such an organization must be incredible. A bloody and violent history, I have no doubt, but an interesting one nevertehless.\nAs far as I know, the level of sentience required to become a Fractallite is not particulrly high. It just necessitattes the intelligence to understand the concept of duty that needs fulfilling, and the ability to care about it. Because of this, technically, a dog would meet the requirements to Ascend.\nThis explains the seemingly strange makeup of the creatures composing the Twilight Horde. Many of them, even at the top of the Horde, are about as smart as a dog. \nThere really is not a lot of agency in the Twilight Horde. The powers of the Experienced Cori were capable or influencing the wants for the rest of the Horde, and the Great Beasts appear to have an attachment to Densos and Reyvor. At its core, it is these bonds that keep the Horde together.\nAs I witness them, I struggle to feel anger. There is a certain level of humanity in this seat of power. \nA humanity which, on the other hand, I struggle to see in the Twilight Demon and the Soul Fiend. \nAs part of this leadership structure, each member plays a role, and thinking is solely relegated to these last two. Two ancient Fractallites, who could be considered Elder Ones if they hadn\u0027t decided to simply play the role of deal-makers. \nTheir motivations are what started this war.",
