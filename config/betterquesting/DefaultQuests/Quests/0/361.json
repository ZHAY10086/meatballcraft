      "desc:8": "The nice thing about now being more or less an even match for Fractallites, is that I can study them as I fight. To cut them off from their powers, I suspect another confrontation, at a more basic level of existance, will be necessary. But for now, these initial fights should be enough to hold them off for a while, and to fragment the leadership of the Horde.\nYes, those responsible for Twilight Horde being as it is now are the two Great Minds. They are the ones that started this whole thing.\nThe Soul Fiend\u0027s power revolves around constrained free will, onto which it feeds; the more fall under its power, the more it grows.\nThe Twilight Demon\u0027s magic, on the other hand, requires blind worship.\nWhile I cannot begin to guess what are the roles these Fractallite powers play in the grand balance of the universe, and what the original missions of these two beings may have been, what I suspect put them on this path was their need for control of others to grow in power.\nIn the history of the Horde, I suspect, the Experienced Cori must have been a fundamental piece for the schemes of the Great Minds.\nThe entirety of the Twilight Horde\u0027s power structure revolves around control. Only two minds are tasked to think.\nYes, while I am still abhorred by the actions of the Horde as a whole, I struggle to feel resentment against them. \nEveryone, memebers of a vast colony, a hive fueled by instinct.\nDo I blame them for being part of it? I cannot.\nAnd yet, I do not regret leaving scorched worlds behind them. The creatures I left behind, now free in their will, will have to rebuld their worlds, and will have to decide what to make of their lives. I wish them best of luck.",
