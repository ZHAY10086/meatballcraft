Well, I guess I am, or else I would not have been given access to this place, Gallifrey.\nThe coordinates of the wormholes I have traversed, until now, have been bound to special material with recursive properties. This one, though is different. It is bound directly to a fractallite recursion, to a raw recursive power, like the ones that the creatures of Nero possess.\nThis one is not bound to an emotion such as fear, nor to a concept such as darkness; this is the recursive power of an attribute, worthiness. So yes, I am worthy. But worthy of what?\nThat's the loophole behind much of the magic I have encountered. The warriors of Barathos follow the power of honor in battle, but that does not make them honorable; fighting honorably for a non-honorable cause is enough for them to fulfill their pact, and maintain their powers. A similar loophole, I suspect, is what makes me worthy of Gallifrey.",
