      "desc:8": "I may have made a mistake, not fully knowing the rules of Fractallite powers. Once the holder of a given power falls, the magic they cast is not reversed. The gift of Immortality coming from the Immortal Fractallites still endures after their defeat.\nThis does not follow the same logic as the other powerful magic I have encountered; or any magic I have encountered, to be fair. \nThe vessel is important to magic. Once it is taken away, the weave of recursion falters. That is how I could wiggle out of my own recursion prison, by beating up J'zahar and the Primordial Malevolence. Sure, I am yet to escape this prison fully, so it is definitely possible to ensure some permanence when casting powerful spells, but the fall of the caster, looking at every single example I have seen of this, does have an effect.\nHere, though, nothing changed. Is it that the rules are different for Fractallites, or that I simply did not really defeat these enemies?",
