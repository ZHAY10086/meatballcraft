      "desc:8": "No, it is not over. It is far from over.\nMy actions opened up a new possibility, now an inevitability, that lifetime enemies would find themselves unlikely allies. Well not allies, more than that.\nThe powers of XXeus had been unleashed, after all. The powers of the Recursive King, the powers to rule, absolutely.\nThe powers to subject an army of Recursive beings, absolutely.\nThe Twilight Horde and the Shyre Empire are not enemies anymore. The magic of the Recursive King, which I now suspect was used once before to face the Bees, brought them together against me.\nA prison of Recursion. Power made servitude. Any and all power made servitude. Tracing all the sources that come into forming this prison alone is an undertaking. Multiple locks, multiple layers to this prison. And all are enmeshed.\nAnd yet, it must be done.\nRighteousness is only part of what drives me. The rest is want for a fight. And a fight is what I got. There is a sort of irony to this. I realized that freeing Terra was not enough to bring me closure, I realized that I just wanted to fight on.\nAnd now, in the skies of Terra, the fight my subconscious was craving, the bloody challenge of a bored god, is what will finally free Terra.\nI guess I should feel some relief. The revelation that almost made me give up on my mission is now the only thing that can help me fullfill it. I guess that is what it means to Ascend, to commit with the entirety of my being, including that hungry subconscious that wants to fight on. Fate has a great sense of humor.",
