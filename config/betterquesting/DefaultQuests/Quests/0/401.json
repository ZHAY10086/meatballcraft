How can I go deeper into the Mythic shells if I cannot defeat the Fractallites that inhabit the current Shell.\nAfter some experimentation, I could produce a gem of great power, imbued with my own recursive powers. It is not yet complete, though; just like the chickens that were left with part of Bane's powers of time and entropy, this gem is not yet fully powered.\nOnce I finally ascend to Fractallite, that is when it will too be perfected, and that is when I shall resume my journey into the Mythic Shells!",
