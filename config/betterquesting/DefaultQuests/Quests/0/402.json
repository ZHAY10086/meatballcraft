By picking up a crystal?\nAs hard it may be to believe, yes, that may be how it happens.\nI still could be wrong, as I do not yet know how these recursive gems work, but my suspicion about them being communication devices does make sense. They are tied in between the Mythic Shells of the Twilight Horde, and their removal from their locations has caused chaos and disorganization among enemy troops.\nThat is the effect I would expect from removing the Internet back on Earth. Communication is a powerful weapon, some may even say the most powerful.\nWhile I would really like to say this is over, I do not think it is. Holding on to the gem of Skythern, I know that it is not the final world of the Mythic Shells, so whoever lives and rules in the next one will eventually reinstate these communication lines.\nI hope at least I scared them enough to make them careless...",
