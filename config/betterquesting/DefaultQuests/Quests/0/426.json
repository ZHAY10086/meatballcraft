Or one powerful dragon existing in many places at once.\nAs matter gains more and more entropy, its chaoticity eventually passes a threshold, one that is not naturally achievable, and yet possible through magic, where fundamental particles exhibits all possible configurations predicted by their quantum field; in other words, true chaos.\nCrystals of this state of matter, given enough energy, can self-replicate, and make more of themselves; so while I still don't know how this is possible in the first place, I can get my hands on more and more of this stuff to study it.",
