Those that cannot fight are destroyed, that is the way of my opponents.\nThe people of this place still cherish their past as alchemists, and safekeep what remains of their stock of dark matter with great jealousy.\nWhat is interesting, very interesting, about this is the fact that the ability to perform alchemy can be taken away, and, I suspect, given as well. This calls for some more research!",
