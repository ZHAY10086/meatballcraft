      "desc:8": "Here it is, Runandor! I had heard of this place from within the Deeplands. The people of this place are the ones that were so interested about the Charged Runium found there, and its alchemical properties.\nThe land of Runandor appears to be one of the worlds at the head of the Shyre Empire's military hirearchy. Runation, the subset of alchemy that has been snobbed by the Testificates, is key to the power of this place's forces.\nWhile it is indeed outclassed by other things that are easily achievable through alchemy, runation is an accessible form of this art that is accessible to others who do not possess this innate ability. Through runes, everyone can perform magic, and with enough runes, this magic can be quite destructive.\nThis is what makes Runandor so key in this conflict, its masters of runation are the only way the Shyre Empire can perform alchemy. \nWhy is it so hard for them to get their hands on actual alchemists? I still have no idea, but I suspect I will learn soon enough.",
