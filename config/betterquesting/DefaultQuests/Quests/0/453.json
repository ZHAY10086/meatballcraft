      "desc:8": "Apichisi, where the Testificates gave up, and passed the torch to the Bubbell alliance.\nUp next in the list of beacon worlds where wormholes like to open, is the final buffer world of the Shyre Empire. Well, was the final buffer world of the Shyre Empire.\nIn an act similar to the Wizards of Vibe, drastic actions were taken to ensure that the world would not be in control of anyone. Unlike Vibe, though, this action did not involve any sort of world-ending magic that turned the planet into an unlivable wasteland.\nWhat the Bees did was actually take advantage of the encounters their civilization had with other powerful beings, gave them coordinates to reach Apichisi, and told them of the powerful mineral that permeates its soil. What followed was a multi-front war not unlike Terra's.\nI may have to reconsider my opinions about the navety of Bees. I guess it makes sense giver their vows, but the idea is quite diabolical; so diabolical, as a matter of fact, that I doubt it originally came from the Bubbell Alliance.",
