Resonating Stone, the material that pulls wormholes towards the planet, is powerful and desirable, but not as much as Dimensional Shards; so whenever the 'allies' of the Bees came, the Shyre Empire simply left, not deeming the conflict worth wasting precious resources they could expend against the Twilight Horde.\nI am sure that battles were still fought, but whatever happened, it likely left one of these 'allies' in a position advantageous enough that it would have required much bigger players, possibly even the higher-ups of the Shyre Empire, to come in and even out the odds.\nWhat happened after, well, is what likely will happen to Terra if the stalemate ever were to resolve. The planet has been completely gutted of Resonating Stone. What is left of it are reserves kept by the Bees now in control of the world, who are using it to jumpstart their infrastructure.\nThankfully, this material has alchemical properties, so I really only need a small amount, and I can make more.",
