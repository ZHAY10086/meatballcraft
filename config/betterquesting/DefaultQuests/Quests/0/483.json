My vision sometimes goes dark. This place is doing something to me. Something very bad.\nThe sight of Omothol was still maddening, but I would still take it over this. Any more time in this place, and I am afraid I will turn into a crazy clown myself. The laughs are contageous, they never escape my mind, I keep hearing them. They do not stop. They cannot stop.",
