Voxxulon, its ruler, is a being from a long lost era, and the recursive powers of this creature are the main driver of this planet's history. The power to change biology of those that submit under their rule.\nThis ability is what allows this world to keep functioning; it made it so all that live here, and who have sworn fealty to Voxxulon, are now immune to every deranged experiment this world has and will ever experience. Those that didn't swear, they are long gone as victims of said experiments.\nI am still not 100% sure, but I strongly suspect the beings of Creeponia to be a result of a similar process, possibly undergone through Voxxulon themselves, or done by a recursive being of similar powers.
