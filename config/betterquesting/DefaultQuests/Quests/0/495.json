It was a trap! \nIt felt strange to be able to be able to follow the trace of a wormhole to a world that intentionally and strategically tried to dissociate its name from the Shyre Empire. That's because they wanted me here. And I came like the eager little puppet I am.\nMystite, the metal that fills the underground of this world, has a most peculiar recursive property, which has transfered to most of the fungal and fungo/animal life here, the ability to mimic magical powers.\nWhatever magical knowledge I had, now the Shyre Empire has too...\nFortunately, though, the master of this power, the king of this land of mushrooms, was defeated before the transfer was complete, but I worry I may have revealed some of the secrets of the Testificates and the bees.",
