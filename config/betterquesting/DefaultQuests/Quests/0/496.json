The Shyre Empire too.\nUnlike the former, the intelligence gathering capabilities of the latter seem to be more circumscribed, likely due to its power structure being less caring of its fighters, but also more specialized.\nMysterium is home to a guild of spy sorcerers, who seem to be aligned with many other factions, including the monsters in the Abyssal Wastelands, and do not openly affiliate themselves with the Shyre Empire to maintain their specific advantage. Unfortunately for them, though, I could sense the trace of their wormholes.\nThere is something about this place that disturbs me. My attunement with magic seems to be weakened. I can still perform, and yet it feels 'different'.",
