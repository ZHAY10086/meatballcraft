Those words, to be fair, fail to fully encompass the nature of Iromine, the warrior world of metal. \nIf the warriors of Barathos are akin to the Roman Empire, a proud nation with a strong foundation in personal power and battle prowess, Iromine's forces are the Huns, a horde of violent war criminals.\nI suspect religion plays very little role at holding this place under the Empire. The call for violence appears to be more than enough.\n",
