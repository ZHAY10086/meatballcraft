      "desc:8": "Here is a cool application of draconic magic, this strange yet powerful manipulation of entropy used as a means of empowerment. It can be used to build compact, efficient, and comfortable roosts that chickens really seem to enjoy.\nReproduction is one of life's mechanisms to 'fight' the second law of thermodynamics, the inevitable (at least with my current knowledge) tendency of the universe to fall into homogenuity. The ability of manipulating this very force, to an extent, produces very fertile chickens, and that means more useful eggs for me! \nI cannot reverse this law of the universe, but it seems draconic magic can create lots of gray areas where I can make interesting things.",
