The extent to which they are capable of returning after being 'killed', and their omnipresence abilities are far above the troops of the Shyre Empire.\nThis may solely have to do with different philosphies of doing war, where one faction is more liberal to arm their troops, while the other is more willing to use them as cannon fodder.\nAnyhow, the source of their power seems to come from outside of the Eden, maybe from some higher dimensions, and it is channeled into this world using special gems.\nI better get my hands on some, they may come in handy for the future.",
