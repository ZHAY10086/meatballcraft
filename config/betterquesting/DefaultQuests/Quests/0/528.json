      "desc:8": "I think I may have been looking at what's happening under the wrong lens. Ever since I ended up on Terra, I always assumed that what has happened may just be some sort of coincidence, but it is evident this was not the case.\nThe Meatball Man, for some reason, was able to convince the Primordial Malevolce and other eldritch creatures to give me powers and bind me to recursion. I always assumed this 'pact' would have involved anyone who showed up on Terra through a wormhole. The Meatball Man clearly wants to do something on Terra, and I suspect this may have to do with the Arbiter, so it would make sense he is trying to take control over any new external influences, such as me.\nIf that's the case, though, why is it only me that ended up there? Why haven't I seen others show up? With such a large and populated universe that can use wormholes, why am I the only one that opened one to Terra? \nI have been trying to find answers externally, but it may be time to take a good look at myself.",
