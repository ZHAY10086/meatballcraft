      "desc:8": "This knowledge is hurting me, there is no denying it. The more I delve into this crazy war, the more I became aware of a complete lack of closure. \nLearning new things is supposed to satify me! That is why I got into science to begin with. I wanted my hunger, my thirst, to be satisfied.\nBut it could not. Knowledge is infinite, but I was not.\nCan this be changed? I was a mere mortal back then (or was I?). I'm not one anymore. I have infinite time, that's why I am fighting this war to begin with.\nMy mind, though, is still bound to mortal needs. Knowing as much as possible, learning as much as possible before I am gone. That was my impetus back then, that's what drove me. I wanted to play my part in the progress of humanity.\nBut now, even though after all I have seen, this ambition, it seems so little, so mininiscule. \nThe more I see, the less I udnerstand. A question answered, ten more show up, and I feel more and more miniscule in front of this infinity. And yet, I yearn for more.",
