      "desc:8": "I did not expect to encounter Testificates on Pixonia, but here they are!\nActing as an inside group from the Fluix Historians, some agents were able to follow some of the minions of the Meatball Man into Pixonia, and were able to collect intelligence for the sake of their master, the Arbiter. \nWhat set off the Meatball Man's attack on the Testificates was not the knowledge over Dimensional Shards alone; both beings, after all, commonly got involved in the happenings of many civilizations, one reaping chaos, one bringing order. \nWhat started it all was the implication behind this knowledge, a truth that the Arbiter was supposed to keep secret. Thanks to what was taught to the Testificates, though, the Meatball Man was able to piece it together, and driven by desire, he came into Terra, and caused the conflict that I am now fighting.\nGiven the knowledge of these agents, I thought of asking them what had happened to the Arbiter when they fought back, and what the Meatball Man may want to get out of me; as in the case of my prior encounters with the Fluix Historians, no replies, just oddly specific questions.\nSure, whenever I entered Terra there was a Solar Eclipse, but why does it matter?",
