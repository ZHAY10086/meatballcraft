      "desc:8": "§7§oThe pumpjack is used to produce infinite amounts of fluids from Immersive Engineering veins. These are not like normal fluid deposits, and they do not exist in-world. Each chunk has one vein.\n\nTo identify a vein, place a core sample drill into a chunk, give it power, and right click it to start it. It will produce a core sample, with the name of the ore vein and fluid vein in that chunk.\n\nTo extract the fluid deposit, build the Pumpjack multiblock in the corresponding chunk. \n\n\n",
